[[mario siqueira|I'm a]] product person living in [[buenos aires|the city of fury]]. I'm driven by hard problems and seek to improve the experience and productivity for makers and doers.

Right now I do that as a lead product designer in the emergent field of web3. 

Previously worked at [Satellogic](http://satellogic.com), [Mulesoft](http://mulesoft.com) and [Bayer](https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/). Before that I designed for [Davis Lab (Oxford)](https://davislab-oxford.org/see-lit-in-action-2/), Audi, Unilever and for Rogers, Tomtom, Sensium, Blackberry, [GravityLight](https://deciwatt.global/gravitylight) (and others) at [Therefore](https://www.therefore.com/).

This is my&mdash;as [they say](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880)&mdash;[[digital garden]].
