Being fascinated by Mars is trendy these days. Yet, my personal fascination has started early as a kid, almost as soon as I could read.

One explanation for this fascination could be traced to the coincidences I've discovered through life that makes this planet so personal to me.

For one, my given name could be traced to the Roman god that names the planet. This is not so special given that I'm far from the only person in 3 generations in my family to be given this name.

But then I realized that I was born on a Tuesday on the month of March, on a date that makes me an Aries.

Tuesday - dies Martis in Latin, Martes in Spanish - is the day of Mars, the Roman God. March, as you may infer, is also the month dedicated to Mars.

How about Aries? That's the greek name for the ram, the zodiac sign - how is it related to Mars at all?

Well - besides the fact that in my teenage ignorance I just ignored the 'i' and made it Ares, the greek version of the Roman God - Aries is ruled by Mars.

Certainly this is all silliness and the "coincidence" I named above can be explained by the closeness of the cultures that gave rise to them (ie. Romans having adopted much of Greek culture) but still, I consider this part of my personal mythology, my personal spirituality.
